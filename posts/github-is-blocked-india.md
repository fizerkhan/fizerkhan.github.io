[GitHub](https://github.com/) is blocked in India along with [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) and [imgur](http://imgur.com/).

Since 17th December Indian ISPs have started blocking the free Git hosting
repository GitHub. No prior information, no explanations, no notice,
simple block. The ISPs in India are setting a bad precedent of freedom of speech.
Only one ISP, Reliance returned a message that GitHub has been blocked as per the
instructions of competent authority.

The Indian government also asked telecom operators and ISPs to block the
image sharing site `imgur` and popular paste hosting website, `Pastebin`.

It is really a bad news for the fast growing Indian economy.
Hope, it will be resolved soon. If you are in India, you can use the following solution.

### Add Google DNS Server

This can be solved by adding Google DNS server. If you are a Mac OSX user,
following steps will help you

1. Choose `Apple menu > System Preferences`, and then click `Network`.

2. Select the Network connection service you want to use (such as Wi-Fi or AirPort or Ethernet, unless you named it something else) from the list, and then click `Advanced`.

3. Select `DNS` tab

4. Click `+` to replace any listed addresses with, or add, the Google IP addresses at the top of the list:

  - For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.
  - For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844

When youâ€™re finished, click `OK` and then `Apply`. Now you can access the blocked sites.
